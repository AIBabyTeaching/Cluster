SFTP:
- Upload (upload to cluster)
- Download (Download from cluster to local)

Why not Github?
- Github is okay to be an interconnector between the Cluster and the Local but it requires a key
- So for simplicity and easy utilization we directly connect2cluster.

SFTP Extension not showing properly:
- Settings of the SFTP extension (Add + Download)
- CTRL+Shift+P (Interpreter) 
- Open SFTP: Config

First Ensure that we are connected to FortiClient.

______________________________________

Before we get started with the environment we need to make sure that the requirements.txt is already uploaded on the cluster.
